# Skada for MoP (5.4.8)
My fork of Skada with the parts I liked from "Details!".  
Currently only working on enUS / enGB clients due to lack of translations.  

# Extras
1. Seperate bar and bar background textures.
2. Seperate class colour toggles for name and data texts.
3. Adjustable update rate between 0.05 and 1. **Note: This does impact cpu-usage.**
4. Smooth texture / bar updates.

# To-Do
1. Identify unit specialisation. This will be hard without third-party libraries (LibInspect) or heavy caching.  
 May have inconsistencies due to different server inspect API cooldowns.
2. Class specialisation icons.
